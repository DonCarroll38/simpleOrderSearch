This is the first time I've called a Web API controller from c# code.  I've always called Web API services from Javascript, jQuery, AngularJs or Angular, not C#. I tried 4 or 5 different examples on google and each of them had little quirks that never returned the data.  I got back a 404 - Not Found error everytime or a CORS error.  I did enable CORS on the Web API project but I still got back a 404 Error.  I was able to call a get test controller from the browser with success and get back data.
